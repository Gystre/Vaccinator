# Vaccinator

Unfortunately this works very poorly since attacking the .text section of steamservice.dll inside of steam.exe after shutting down steamservice.exe IS A VERY BIG NO NO. I got banned in like 20 min (lol), while it might have been for naught, I now have a better understanding of what, why, and how vac does what it does. Next bypass we're going kernel, maybe use KeStackAttachProcess using a vulnerable driver or smthn and probably recycle the UI cuz I really like it :3.
